## I. Setup:

** make sure you replicate the exact folder structure listed below for the datasets for the relative path imports to work **

1. Create an empty folder called **data** at the base level. Inside **data**, create 2 subfolders called **bd** and **cl**. These will store the clean and dirty datasets.
3. Download the clean and dirty datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rs68uH8Xqa4j6UxG53wzD0uyI8347dSq). Store these inside data/cl and data/bd respectively.

2. The files *bd_net.h5* and *bd_weights.h5* contain the model and its weights. 

## II. Execution:

1. Run *HW_2_Sol.ipynb*
